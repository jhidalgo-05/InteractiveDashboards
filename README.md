# 📊 Soccer Data Visualization — Vega-Lite & Altair

This project explores a simple football (soccer) dataset using two powerful visualization tools:

- Vega-Lite (browser-based JSON grammar for declarative charts)

- Altair (Python wrapper for Vega-Lite)

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how both tools can be used to create:

✓ simple charts
✓ transformed charts (binning, aggregation, calculations)
✓ fully interactive visualizations
✓ cross-filtering and tooltips
✓ a smoother user experience when exploring the data
